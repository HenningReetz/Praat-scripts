# Praat-scripts

This repository contains several Praat scripts. 
Many are rather complex and allow different types of computations (not all can be selected in the form window, because it would become too long; but the associated manuals point out what can be easily changed in the scripts). 
I always hope to update everything to a more coherent ‘standard’, but as always, it will take time.

Any error reports or suggestions for improvements to <reetz.phonetics@gmail.com>

A short descrition of the files will follow shortly (i.e., in the next days or weeks).
